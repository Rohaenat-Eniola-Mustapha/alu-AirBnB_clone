# AirBnB Clone Project

This is the first step towards building an AirBnB clone, starting with a command interpreter in Python.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows you to manage objects related to the AirBnB project. It enables you to:

- Create new objects (e.g., User, Place)
- Retrieve objects from files or databases
- Perform operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alu-AirBnB_clone.git
   cd alu-AirBnB_clone
